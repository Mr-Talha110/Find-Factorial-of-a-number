Explanation:

We first take input from user and store that value in variable named “n”. 
Then we initialize a variable “factorial” with value 1 (i.e factorial=1.0) and variable i with value 1(i.e i=1). 
Repeat next two steps until i is less than n.
Multiply factoial with current value of i
Increment i with 1
At last, print the value of factorial.
Let’s take an example,
Let the input be 5.
The equation that gets created by our algorithm is 5x4x3x2x1.
So, The Factorial of 5 is 120(5x4x3x2x1).
